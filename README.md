# Welcome to the Autonomous-robot-using-supervised learning wiki!

* There will be four placard with name "GO" "LEFT" "RIGHT" "STOP"
* Once any random placard is shown in front of the camera, it image processes and give to machine learning code
* Image classification using the supervised learning is done and the respective commands are sent to the base chassis
* further the robot moves accordingly with respect to the shown placard
* The architecture was completely build using Robot operating system
